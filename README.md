# Employee-Engagement-Survey-Analysis
This project explores what employees value most, identifies areas of low engagement, and provides data-driven recommendations to improve satisfaction and workplace culture.

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project explores real employee engagement survey responses collected by **Pierce County, WA**.  
The goal was to uncover what employees value most, identify key areas of dissatisfaction, and recommend data-driven strategies to improve workplace satisfaction.

As a Data Analyst, I analyzed **14,725 responses** using Excel Pivot Tables to reveal trends by department, role, and survey question.

## Dataset Summary
- **Records:** 14,725  
- **Fields (Columns):** 10  
- **Source:** Pierce County Employee Engagement Survey  
- **Data Type:** Clean (no missing or invalid entries)

---

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel** — for data analysis, visualization, and reporting  
- **Pivot Tables** — to group and summarize responses  
- **Charts** — to visualize department and role trends  
- **Slicers** — for interactivity (Status, Department, Response Text)

---

## Data Preparation
The dataset was already clean, so minimal transformation was required.  
However, to make analysis easier, I:
- Grouped similar responses together:
- *“Agree” + “Strongly Agree” → “Agree”*
- *“Disagree” + “Strongly Disagree” → “Disagree”*
- Ignored *“Not Available”* responses for clarity.
- Created separate Pivot Tables for each analytical question.

## Analysis & Insights

### **Question 1:**  
*Which survey questions did respondents agree or disagree with most?*

- The statement **“I know what is expected of me at work”** had the **highest agreement** and **lowest disagreement** rate.  
- The statement **“I have a best friend at work”** had the **highest disagreement** and **lowest agreement** rate.  

*Insight:*  
Employees understand their job expectations clearly but may struggle with building strong workplace friendships or peer connections.

---

### **Question 2:**  
*Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?*

Using Pivot Tables for **Role (Staff, Supervisor, Manager, Director)** and **Response Text:**

- **Directors** mostly agreed with statements like:
  - *“At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best.”*
  - *“I know what is expected of me at work.”*
  - *“The mission or purpose of our organization makes me feel my job is important.”*
  - Their main disagreement: *“I have a best friend at work.”*

- **Staff, Supervisors, and Managers** all showed the same pattern:
  - *Highest agreement:* “I know what is expected of me at work.”
  - *Highest disagreement:* “I have a best friend at work.”

🪄 *Insight:*  
All levels of employees have a clear understanding of their roles but face challenges in workplace connection and engagement.

### **Question 3:**  
*As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction?*

🗒 **Recommendation Summary:**
> The survey reveals that employees clearly understand their roles and appreciate opportunities for growth and inclusion.  
> However, there are significant gaps in recognition and workplace connection, especially among staff and supervisors.  
> Strengthening recognition programs, promoting team bonding, and improving performance feedback systems could enhance overall satisfaction.
